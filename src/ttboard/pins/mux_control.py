        The MUX is a 4-Bit 1-of-2, so has 4 pairs of 
        GPIO that are selected in unison by a single
        signal.
        
        The circuit is organized such that either:
         * all the outputs tied to the mux are selected; or
         * all the control signals are selected
         
        and this selector is actually the HK SPI nCS line.
        
        These facts are included here for reference, the 
        MuxControl object is actually unaware of the 
        specifics and this stuff happens either transparently
        or at higher levels
